# Licensed Investment Advisor in Loveland, CO

Brian Joyce CPA/CFP ® is a licensed investment advisor in Loveland, CO. He has been helping people redefine their idea of retirement since 2004. He believes that retirement is not a specific time in a person’s life—retirement is a state of mind. It is when people are at their happiest, living life without stress. Brian’s goal for his clients is to have them always living in the retirement mindset.

Financial planning and investing are passions for Brian, which is why he started his own firm, Intelligent Investing. In 2001, Brian graduated cum laude from the University of Massachusetts – Amherst with a bachelor’s degree in Accounting. He is not only a licensed investment advisor, but also a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® and CPA.

## Working for the Client’s Best Interest

The business of retirement planning and investing is constantly evolving, which is why Brian devotes himself to rigorous, ongoing education to ensure that he is always on top of changing laws, compliance regulations, and new strategies. In addition, he organizes and speaks at regional seminars and writes articles for business journals.

Brian is a fee-only advisor, meaning that he does not receive commissions on the financial plans or products he sells. Without the conflict of interest that accompanies sales commissions, Brian offers unbiased advice that is always in the client’s best interest. The best measure of success, to his mind, is in helping each client achieve their long-term investment goals.

To better serve his clients, Brian offers comprehensive advice and insight on a range of financial topics. To start with, he helps his clients define what retirement means for them. Not all individuals have the same expectations of their retirement years. By understanding each client as a unique person, Brian develops the most appropriate strategies for meeting personal goals.

## Financial Consultations for Peace of Mind

Although successfully planning for retirement may seem daunting now, by setting achievable short-term and mid-term objectives, it’s not as difficult as it may seem. Brian excels at helping clients set their targets and get on track for a comfortable, fulfilling retirement. The trick is first learning a little about retirement planning and investing, then committing to a workable savings and investment plan, and finally tweaking it as needed over time to adjust for newer goals or changes in income. As an experienced and dedicated retirement and investment advisor, Brian considers it his honor to help clients do just that.

Managing a retirement plan is not a one-time effort; it requires attention and care. With Brian’s services, clients enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have an informed and engaged advisor working on their behalf. The day-to-day demands of work and family take enough time and attention already. By trusting a qualified and skilled retirement advisor, clients can focus more on today without worrying about tomorrow.

## Committed to Our Local Community

Brian is always looking for ways to give back to the Northern Colorado community. He coaches youth sports, volunteers for charitable events, and is currently serving on the Board of Directors at Teaching Tree Early Childhood Learning Center. Most importantly, he is a devoted husband and a father to three amazing children.
