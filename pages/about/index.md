# CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ in Fort Collins, CO

Brian Joyce CPA/CFP ® is a licensed financial advisor in Fort Collins, CO. He has been helping people redefine their idea of retirement since 2004. He believes that retirement is not a specific time in a person’s life—it is a state of mind. It is when people are at their happiest, living life without stress. Brian’s goal for his clients is to have them always living in the retirement mindset and enjoying a stress free and fulfilled life.

Financial planning, investing and tax work are passions for Brian, which is why he started his own fee-only financial planning firm, Intelligent Investing, in 2017. He is not only a licensed investment advisor, but also a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® and registered CPA.

## Working for the Client’s Best Interest

Brian is a fee-only financial planner, meaning that he does not receive commissions on the financial plans or investment vehicles he recommends. Without the conflict of interest accompanying sales commissions, Brian can offer unbiased advice that is always in the client’s best interest.

To ensure you stay on track with your financial life plan and make adjustments as time passes, Brian will meet with you on a regular basis throughout the year.&nbsp; In addition, you will receive easy to read and transparent investment performance reports on a monthly basis.&nbsp; Your fees are collected on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; This gives Brian incentive to service you at a high level throughout your life and it allows you an opportunity to evaluate your relationship and ensure you are getting the proper value in return for your fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Committed to Our Local Community
