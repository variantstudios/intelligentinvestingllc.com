# Brian Joyce CPA/CFP ®

Brian has been helping people redefine their idea of retirement since 2004. He believes that retirement is not a specific time in a person’s life; rather, it is a state of mind. It is when you are at your happiest and live stress free. Brian’s goal for his clients is to have them always living retirement.

Financial planning and investing is a passion for Brian which is why he started his own firm, Intelligent Investing. In 2001, Brian graduated cum laude from the University of Massachusetts – Amherst with a bachelor’s degree in Accounting. He is not only a licensed investment advisor, but also a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® and CPA. He devotes himself to rigorous continuing education, ensuring he is always on top of changing laws, compliance regulations and new strategies. In addition, he organizes and speaks at regional seminars and writes articles for business journals.

Brian is always looking for ways to give back to the Northern Colorado community. He coaches youth sports, volunteers for charitable events and is currently serving on the Board of Directors at Teaching Tree Early Childhood Learning Center. Most importantly, he is a devoted husband and a father to three amazing children.
