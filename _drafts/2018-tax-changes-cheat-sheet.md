  It is February 8, 2018 and there have been 27 days the stock market has been
  open in 2018.  This week feels like whirlwind.  There have been 2 days
  (including today) where the S&P 500 (an index that tracks the largest 500 U.S.
  based companies) dropped over 3.50% in one day.  I have been fielding a lot of
  questions and one of the more popular ones is, “Is this normal?”  That is
  usually followed up with, “What do I do?”.  I’ll do my best to help answer
  both questions.
