One of the most frequent questions I get is how should I invest my cash or savings.&nbsp; Money outside of your retirement plans.&nbsp; Most people will throw all their savings into a zero-interest bearing account and never look back.&nbsp; It is understandable that we don’t want to subject our hard-earned savings to a lot of risk, but I believe there are ways to keep it safe and make it work for us at the same time.&nbsp; Here is how I break down the various levels of saving:

1. **Emergency Fund** – This is the cash you will tap into if something unexpected happens.&nbsp; It is money you will want on hand if your car breaks down, the roof starts leaking or the water heater stops working.&nbsp; A good rule of thumb is to have about 3 months of living expenses available for use.&nbsp; If you are a homeowner an effective way to cover this emergency fund is to take out a line of credit on your house.&nbsp; It is cheap to maintain and most likely you will never need to use it.&nbsp; Just make sure you are not tempted to tap into it for non-emergencies like a trip to Hawaii or a new couch.&nbsp; If you do not own a home or don’t have the equity available for a line of credit, cash will do the trick.&nbsp; My suggestion would be to find a high interest-bearing savings account.&nbsp; A website like nerdwallet will help in this search.&nbsp; As of the posting of this blog you should be able to find something in the 1.30% range.
2. **Mid-Range Cash** – After you have your emergency savings set up, I suggest having another 3 months of savings available to help cover an extended leave from work, or larger types of emergencies.&nbsp; For this bucket of money, you can be slightly more aggressive than the emergency fund as the likelihood of you needing it is less.&nbsp; If you are in a low tax bracket you can explore a low-risk bond ETF or mutual fund.&nbsp; I would start with something like iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) or Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND).&nbsp; If you are in a higher income tax bracket and want tax free earnings, consider a municipal bond fund in the state you reside.&nbsp; The year to year return on these types of investments is not guaranteed, but the volatility and risk is on the low end of the spectrum.&nbsp; Any losses incurred shouldn’t derail you savings plan too much.&nbsp; I would highly suggest contacting a financial advisor before purchasing, just so you understand all the risks involved.
3. **Longer Range Cash** – This is cash for a rainy day or to help you sleep better at night.&nbsp; You most likely wouldn’t need it for 2 plus years down the road.&nbsp; My suggestion for this level of cash would be a conservative allocation fund.&nbsp; Something like Vanguard Wellesley Income (VWINX) has low fees and a good long-term track record of consistent returns with a low level of risk.&nbsp; As in the funds suggested for the mid-range cash, I would strongly suggest doing your research and/or contacting a financial advisor before purchasing.

There are a lot more ways to keep your cash safe and have it work for you.&nbsp; This blog should you get going.&nbsp;
