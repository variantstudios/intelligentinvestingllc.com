Another week and yet another update to the Better Care Act (BCRA) or as known to most Trumpcare. &nbsp;Here are the most up to date tax impacts (most likely to change 100 more times before this thing goes for a vote).

1) **Capital Gains and Medicare Wage Surtax** - Remember that last blog post I had about eliminating the 3.8% tax on investment earnings and the 0.9% surtax for all wages for high income earners? &nbsp;Well yeah, never mind all that. &nbsp;They both now remain under the current version of the BCRA. &nbsp;Here is a quick refresher:

*Capital Gains Tax* - You are assessed an extra 3.8% surtax on capital gains, dividends, and interest income for families earning $250,000 or more (individuals $200,000 or more). &nbsp;

*Medicare Wage Surtax* - You are assessed a 0.9% surcharge for all wages or self-employed income greater than $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. &nbsp;

2) **Health Savings Accounts (HSA)** - Under the new amendment of the BCRA, HSA dollars can be used to pay for your health insurance premiums. Previously, the rules were that HSA funds, which are pre-taxed dollars, could only be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.

3) **Tax Credits** - Under the BCRA, subsidies will be gone and replaced with tax credits that are provided to people based on their age and income level. &nbsp;Under Obamacare, you could only use financial assistance to pay for a Platinum, Gold, Silver or Bronze level plan, but under the BCRA, you can now use the tax credits to also pay for Catastrophic plans or Lower-Premium Health Insurance Plans.&nbsp;

The punchline from my previous blog stays the same. &nbsp;If you earn more than $200,000 as an individual or $250,000 as a family it would be a good time to talk to your CPA and/or financial advisor to discuss any changes in your tax strategy.
