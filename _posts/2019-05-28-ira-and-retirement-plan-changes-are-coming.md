While most of the media is reporting on the Mueller report and potential impeachment proceedings, Congress is currently working on some major changes to company retirement plans and IRA accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The House of Representatives has put together the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019.&nbsp; And at the same time, the Senate Finance Committee is working on a bill titled the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA).&nbsp; The details in both bills are slightly different and ultimately a compromise will be made on a final bill to be signed by the President.&nbsp; Both bills are addressing the following issues:

* ***Changes to the Stretch IRA*** - Currently, if you inherit an IRA account, you have an option to stretch out the distributions from the account over your lifetime.&nbsp; Since distributions are taxed as ordinary income, stretching them out as long as possible reduces the annual tax burden.&nbsp; The current SECURE act would limit this stretching to 10 years for non-spousal inherited IRA accounts.&nbsp; This would create a higher annual tax burden for the recipient.
* ***Age Increase for RMDs***&nbsp;*\*\*from and IRA \*\**\- Under current law, once your turn 70 1/2 years old you need to start taking taxable distributions from your IRA accounts.&nbsp; The SECURE act proposes to increase the age limit to 72, while the RESA Act wants to increase it to 75.
* *\*\*No Age Limit for IRA Contributions \*\**\- Under current law you cannot make IRA contributions once you turn 70 1/2.&nbsp; Both Acts would eliminate that age restriction.
* *\*\*Changes to Retirement Plans \*\**\- The main objective of both Acts is to make it easier for small businesses to set up retirement plans and participants to contribute.&nbsp; Both Acts will offer credits to small businesses for start up costs, make reporting requirements easier and allow for companies to combine plans into something called a multiple employer plan.&nbsp; There are also provisions to make automatic enrollment easier.

The SECURE Act has already been voted through by the House of Representatives at a vote of 417-3 and since the RESA Act is very similar, I would expect something to reach the President later this year.&nbsp; I will offer a more detailed blog posting once something is final.
