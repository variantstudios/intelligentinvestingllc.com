  It is February 8, 2018 and there have been 27 days the stock market has been
  open in 2018.  This week feels like whirlwind.  There have been 2 days
  (including today) where the S&P 500 (an index that tracks the largest 500 U.S.
  based companies) dropped over 3.50% in one day.  I have been fielding a lot of
  questions and one of the more popular ones is, “Is this normal?”  That is
  usually followed up with, “What do I do?”.  I’ll do my best to help answer
  both questions.

It is February 8, 2018 and there have been 27 days the stock market has been open in 2018.&nbsp; This week feels like whirlwind.&nbsp; There have been 2 days (including today) where the S&P 500 (an index that tracks the largest 500 U.S. based companies) dropped over 3.50% in one day.&nbsp; I have been fielding a lot of questions and one of the more popular ones is, “Is this normal?”&nbsp; That is usually followed up with, “What do I do?”.&nbsp; I’ll do my best to help answer both questions.

***Is this normal?***
{: .MsoNoSpacing}

The short answer is yes.&nbsp; But you don’t have to take my word for it.&nbsp; I’ve done some research!&nbsp; There are a lot of ways to talk about volatility, but at the end of the day most people are considered with how often their portfolio goes down.&nbsp; And more importantly, how often does it go down a lot.&nbsp; I went back and tracked every day of the S&P 500 from 2000 – 2016.&nbsp; That is 4,267 days the market was open.&nbsp; Out of those 4,267 days, the S&P 500 dropped 1% or more 619 times (14.51% of the time) and it dropped 2% or more 195 times (4.57% of the time).&nbsp; To simplify, in an average month the S&P 500 will drop 1% or more 3 times and it will drop 2% or more once.&nbsp; It is normal for the stock market to go down.

So far in 2018 (including today’s drop of 3.75%), the S&P 500 has dropped 1% or more 4 times (14.81% of the time) and it has dropped 2% or more 3 times (11.11% of the time).&nbsp; The 1% drops are right on the average from 2000 – 2016. The 2% drops are about double the average, but it is also a very small sample size.

The longer answer is yes, 2018 is very normal.&nbsp; 2017 was not normal at all and it is fresh on everyone’s mind.
{: .MsoNoSpacing}

In 2017, the S&P 500 dropped 1% or more 4 times (1.59% of the time) and it never dropped below 2%.&nbsp; It is by far the year with the least amount of 1% drops since 2000.&nbsp; The next closest is 2006, when the market dropped 1% or more 5.18% of the time.&nbsp; 2017 was far from a normal year and we may not see another one like it for a very long time.

***What do I do?***
{: .MsoNoSpacing}

The short answer is nothing if you are investing for a goal or over a period of time.&nbsp; A sound investment strategy knows all the statistics I listed above and takes that into account going in.&nbsp; If you don’t have an investment strategy that is built for a certain time or goal, this would be an appropriate time to evaluate why you are investing and maybe sit down with an investment advisor.&nbsp;
