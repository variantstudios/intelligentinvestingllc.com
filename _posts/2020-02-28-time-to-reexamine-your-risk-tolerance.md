  I am from the mindset that we should invest having a long-term and goal
  oriented approach. Daily news reports should not dictate how our money is
  invested. With that in mind we should always have an eye on what the economy
  is doing on a macro level. Since 1955, the U.S. has experienced nine
  recessions. My goal with this

  report is to help identify the next recession so that we can make adjustments
  to your investment strategy accordingly.
