  I am from the mindset that we should invest having a long-term and goal
  oriented approach. Daily news reports should not dictate how our money is
  invested. With that in mind we should always have an eye on what the economy
  is doing on a macro level. Since 1955, the U.S. has experienced nine
  recessions. My goal with this

  report is to help identify the next recession so that we can make adjustments
  to your investment strategy accordingly.

  page_description: "As always, this is not an opinion piece. \_For my full stance on the Better Care Act (BCRA) you'll have to wait for my exclusive Rachel Maddow interview airing soon. \_For now, we can look at the tax implications if the current BCRA is passed through the senate."

A lot has changed in the past 6 weeks, since my last economic update newsletter.&nbsp; As a result of the Coronavirus driven global economic shutdown, we are now in the correction quadrant of the economic market cycle (better known as a recession).&nbsp; There is no need to focus on the inverted yield curve and FRED Smoothed recession probability statistics for now.&nbsp; Those tools are used to help predict when the next recession will occur.&nbsp; Once we are clearly out of this current recession, I will add those data points back to the newsletter.

We will keep our focus on the Economic Baseline PI chart to help determine when we start to enter the next phase of the market cycle.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the updated analysis.

**Economic PI Baseline**

By plotting 19 key economic indicators, the BaR Analysis Grid&copy; clarifies current economic conditions and signals how near the economy is to a recession. The mean of coordinates (MoC) is the average of all plotted points. It indicates the overall health of the economy.

There is a lot of data illustrated on the chart.&nbsp; And as April 16, 2020 MoC right where the start of a recession would be.&nbsp; You will also notice that a lot of the data points are literally off the chart.&nbsp; That is due to the large uncertainty of how long this economic shutdown will last and what lasting damage it will cause.&nbsp;

Now that we know we are in a recession, our focus will be on when we are through the recession and into the early recovery phase of the market cycle.

&nbsp;

<u><strong>Investment Strategies</strong></u>

Every recession is different, but there are few general strategies you should always have in place:

* Make sure any equities you hold are good quality and have strong cash positions.&nbsp; In addition, look at equity holdings in the defensive sectors (healthcare, utilities and consumer staples).
* Use this as a time to re-balance your portfolio.&nbsp; It will give you an opportunity to purchase equities at a discount.
* Evaluate your overall risk tolerance.&nbsp; And once we are through this recession consider adjusting your overall asset allocation to be in line with any changes to your risk tolerance.

For this specific recession I would be focused on equity positions that in addition to having strong cash positions will also be able to take advantage of the new standards for living (social distancing, work from home, etc.).&nbsp;
